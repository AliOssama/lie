   <h1 style="text-align:center;">The truth continuum</h1>
    <p align="justify">
    Data visualization is just a model that cannot be perfect. However, we can find a good enough model to represent the "reality"
    of the data. The goal is to create a visualization and a set of data that fits your goal but represent in a non-needlessly complex way.
    The main interpreter of this data is our brain which means when the designer is making a visualization, it is not just a pretty one 
    that is aimed for the eye to be impressed. It is more of a connection between the designer's brain and the audience's. 
	<br>
  Data visualization; however, does not aim for interpretation 100% because that can lead to a lot of misinterpretations against the idea
  the designer is trying to show. For this problem, the designer should simplify data and add text and description to explain the
  visualization, but away from oversimplifying the data.
  <br>
	Human behavior can be laid out in 3 steps: <br>
		-Patternicity bug which is detecting interesting patterns even they are not real.
    <br>
		-Storytelling bug: which is personal interpretations of the observed information.
    <br>
		-Confirmation bug: which is the refusal of accepting what goes against our beliefs.
    <br>
	This leads to a lot of mistakes when we judge without understanding from the designer's point of view. But what is the truth to the
  audience in terms of data visualization? Well, in Cairo's opinion, the truth is not absolute or relative, it is on a spectrum.
  If the spectrum goes from totally true to totally untrue, the model designed/represented will be an intersection in the middle.
  This intersection is between "pure guesswork" and "rational thinking." The more attention the designer puts into discovering the truth,
  the more "totally true" they approach. This is why when you discover a trend that is really interesting, stop and think before
  representing it. Think about what you want to show and how complex should the visualization be. Moreover, think about the big picture, 
  what extraneous variables are there and to what extent does confirmation bias affect you.

<b> An example:</b>
In high school, as a part of a group, we had to do research about water desalination and salt particles removal from the water using
a design we create. When we collected data, there was one outlier from a trial that led the water to be desalinated in a really low 
rate compared to all other trials. In statistics, when we use trendlines/regression lines, any point can affect the whole line. Even 
though our data showed that the more you use the device, the cleaner the water would get, this single point flipped the whole line and
made the representation the exact opposite. Our lie was that we never mentioned this trial and we never put it on our graph. This helped
us show the truth even though we did not show the whole truth that included this single point.
